            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Transformative learning, as a theory, says that the process of
                "perspective transformation" has three dimensions: psychological (changes in understanding of the self),
                convictional (revision of belief systems), and behavioral (changes in lifestyle).

                Transformative learning is the expansion of consciousness through the transformation of basic worldview
                and specific capacities of the self; transformative learning is facilitated through consciously directed
                processes such as appreciatively accessing and receiving the symbolic contents of the unconscious and
                critically analyzing underlying premises.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">What Is A Code?</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules
                to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes
                shortened or secret, for communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium.
                An early example is an invention of language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate
                what they thought, saw, heard, or felt to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the
                distance a voice can carry and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered. The
                invention of writing, which converted spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of
                communication across space and time.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A street beggar can be seen everywhere; at the bus stop, railway
                stations, religious places, markets etc. Some beggars are crippled, lame and some are blind. They are
                unable to earn their livelihood. Whereas some are healthy and they do not deserve our sympathy. We
                should see that they take up some profession. They should not be allowed to beg. On my way to school I
                see a beggar daily. He wears old rags. He is partially blind. I feel pity seeing him but I can’t help it
                I can only pray to God to help him to earn his livelihood.</p>
